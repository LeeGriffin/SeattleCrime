# SeattleCrime
Looking at Seattle crime, geospatial analysis at first. Hopefully get to some time series stuff later

Using an API to pull data from seattle crime data (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)

None of it is all that good haha, never really done geospatial stuff before. 

Will add credits and stuff later, definitely pulled some really cool stuff that other people did
