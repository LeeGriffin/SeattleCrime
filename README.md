# SeattleCrime
Looking at Seattle crime, geospatial analysis at first. Hopefully get to some time series stuff later

Using an API to pull data from seattle crime data (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)

None of it is all that good haha, never really done geospatial stuff before. 

Will add credits and stuff later, definitely pulled some really cool stuff that other people did

---------Geospatial Data---------

Order is:
  1)pakages 
  2)cleaning 
  3)overal look at seattle 
  4)different types(groups) of crime 
  5)sizes of maps
  6)some basic k-cuslter stuff that is bad, but looks kinda cool
