# SeattleCrime
Looking at Seattle crime, geospatial analysis at first. Hopefully get to some time series stuff later 

Using an API to pull data from seattle crime data (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)

None of the code/analysis is all that good haha, just doing it for fun.

Geospatial stuff is done for now

---------Geospatial Data---------

Order is:

  1)cleaning/setup  
  2)overal look at seattle   
  3)different types(groups) of crime   
  4)sizes of maps  
  5)some basic k-cuslter stuff that is bad, but looks kinda cool/intresting. 


Credits: definitely pulled some really cool stuff that other people did

Ilyas Ustun (I belive) for the geospatial backbone of this (One of the few links I used)

Humboldt State University (I think) for the K-means stuff:
